REDIS
----------
Redis is a super-fast in-memory database.
It stores temporary data, messages, and queues efficiently.

In your case:
Redis stores queued “jobs” like send OTP email, generate report, etc.
Workers read jobs from Redis and execute them.

🐂 BullMQ — The Library

BullMQ is a Node.js library that uses Redis to manage background jobs.

You can:

Create queues for tasks (like emailQueue, otpQueue, etc.)

Add jobs to them from your Express routes.

Run workers that process these jobs independently.
